##### INTRODUCTION

This is a pack of programs on chi square fitting for cosmological data. Programming languages used here are mathematica and python.

SN data files in DATA folder are taken from [http://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/](http://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/). Cite them in your paper.

These are just particular examples of chi square fitting. No universal packages are constructed.

BTW, I am new to this chi square technique and pyton.  ==!
