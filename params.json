{"tagline":"chi square fitting of supernovae data","name":"Cochisquare","google":"","body":"##### INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis is a pack of programs on chi square fitting for cosmological data. Programming languages used here are mathematica and python.\r\n\r\nSN data files in DATA folder are taken from [http://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/](http://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/). Cite them in your paper.\r\n\r\nThese are just particular examples of chi square fitting. No universal packages are constructed.\r\n\r\nBTW, I am fresh to this chi square technique and pyton.  ==!","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
